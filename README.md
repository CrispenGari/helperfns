</p>

### Getting started

To start using `helperfns` in your project you run the following command:

```shell
pip install helperfns
```

Or if you wan to install it in notebooks such as jupyter notebooks you can run the code cell with the following code:

```shell
!pip install helperfns
```

### Usage

The `helperfns` package is made up of different sub packages such as:

1. tables
2. text
3. utils
4. visualization
5. torch

### tables

In the tables sub package you can print your data in tabular form for example:

```python
from helperfns.tables import tabulate_data

column_names = ["SUBSET", "EXAMPLE(s)", "Hello"]
row_data = [["training", 5, 4],['validation', 4, 4],['test', 3, '']]
tabulate_data(column_names, row_data)

```

Output:

```shell
+---------------------------------+
|              Table              |
+------------+------------+-------+
| SUBSET     | EXAMPLE(s) | Hello |
+------------+------------+-------+
| training   |          5 |     4 |
| validation |          4 |     4 |
| test       |          3 |       |
+------------+------------+-------+
```

### text

The text package offers two main function which are `clean_sentence`, `de_contract`, `generate_ngrams` and `generate_bigrams`

```python
from helperfns.text import *

# cleans the sentence
print(clean_sentence("text 1 # https://url.com/bla1/blah1/"))
# list of all english words
print(english_words)
# converts strings like `I'm` to 'I am'
print(de_contract("I'm"))

# generate bigrams from a list of word
print(text.generate_bigrams(['This', 'film', 'is', 'terrible']))

# generates n-grams from a list of words
print(text.generate_ngrams(['This', 'film', 'is', 'terrible']))
```

### utils

utils package comes with a simple helper function for converting seconds to hours, minutes and seconds.

Example:

```python
start = time.time()
for i in range(100000):
   pass
end = time.time()

```

Output:

```shell
'0:00:00.01'
```

### visualization

This sub package provides different helper functions for visualizing data using plots.

Examples:

```python
from helperfns.visualization import plot_complicated_confusion_matrix, plot_images, plot_images_predictions, plot_simple_confusion_matrix

# plot predicted image labels with the images
plot_images_predictions(images, true_labels, preds, classes=["dog", "cat"] ,cols=8)

# plot the images with their labels
plot_images(images[:24], true_labels[:24], cols=8)

# plot a simple confusion matrix
y_true = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range (100)]
y_pred = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range (100)]
classes =["dog", "cat"]
plot_simple_confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, classes)

# plot a confusion matrix with percentage value of confusion
y_true = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range (100)]
y_pred = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range (100)]
classes =["dog", "cat"]
plot_complicated_confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, classes)
```

### torch

This is a subpackage that contains other subpackages mainly used when working with `pytorch`. These sub packages are:

1. text
2. models
3. accuracy

### `torch.text`

This package contains the `label_pipeline` and `text_pipeline`. This helper function are normally used when doing text processing in python pytorch.

Example:

```python
from helperfns.torch import text

# converting a sentence into sequence of integer representation.
vocab = {'<unk>': 0, 'this': 1, 'is': 2, 'a': 3, 'dog': 4}
tokenizer = lambda x: x.split(' ')
print(text.text_pipeline("This is a dog that is backing", tokenizer=tokenizer, vocab=vocab, unk_token='<unk>', lower=True))

# converting labels into their integer representation.
labels_dict = {l:i for (i, l) in enumerate(['af', 'en', 'st', 'ts', 'xh', 'zu'])}
print(text.label_pipeline("en", labels_dict=labels_dict))

```

### `torch.models`

This package contains a helper function called `model_params`. This function is used to count the model parameters of a pytorch model. Example:

```python
model_params(my_model)
```

> Note that `my_model` is a python class model instance that is inheriting from the `nn.Module` class.

### `torch.accuracy`

This package contains two helper functions called that are used to calculate the accuracy between predicted labels and real label. These functions are:

1. `binary_accuracy` - used to calculate the binary accuracy between predicted labels and real labels.

```python
y = y.to(device)
predictions = model(X).squeeze(1)
loss = criterion(predictions, y)
acc = binary_accuracy(predictions, y)
print(acc)
```

2. `categorical_accuracy` - used to calculate the categorical accuracy between predicted labels and real labels.

```python
y = y.to(device)
predictions = model(X).squeeze(1)
loss = criterion(predictions, y)
acc = categorical_accuracy(predictions, y)
print(acc)
```
